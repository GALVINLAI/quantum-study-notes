\section{2-2. Hadamard Test}

As the simplest quantum algorithm, let's consider the following quantum circuit (Figure
1) called the Hadamard test. 

That is, the first bit is initialized to $|0\rangle$, the second and subsequent bits are initialized to state $|\psi\rangle$, and the Hadamard gate is first applied to the first bit. Then, the \textbf{control unitary operator $\Lambda(U)$} (see below) is applied, Hadamard gate is again applied to the first bit, and finally the first bit is measured.
